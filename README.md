# wicked_cranium_rarity_order  
  
Quick little script to calculate the rarity order of Craniums using a basic weighting approach.  
  
6 traits each. Just adds the total of the trait value. The lower the total weight, the 'rarer' it is.  

Might not be 100% accurate, but if someone wants to make any ammendments feel free :)

Have uploaded both of the above to repo for ever lasting life and goodness.
